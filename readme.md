## Features

### Phases
Once a movement is started it passes through a set of pre-configured phases. These phases are as follows:
- Inspiration
  - Users can submit media (images, videos, links) to a public board. Each piece of media has a section for comments and can be favourited by users.
- Creation
  - Users can create a 'movement' which consists of a title, description and image which acts as a campaign for the idea.
- Support
  - Users can indicate their support of a movement thus highlighting interest and focussing attention of other contributors.
- Design
  - Users collaboratively design the idea, using tools provided by the system, this is a space to ask questions and submit answers and solutions to problems.
- Plan
  - Once the design has been completed, users summarise the outcome of the phase by creating and submitting plans. A plan is a summary of all of the talking points which aims to fill in any present gaps.
- Tender
  - Once the plans have been submitted, users can declare themselves as businesses and tender for work. During the tender phase they can submit a private tender document and a public tender document alongside submitting answers to a set of public questions.

The timeline for each phase can be configured within the 'Manage Platform' area of the site by administrators.

### Progression
Progression through the phases can either happen in three different ways, this can be configured in the 'Manage Platform' area of the site by administrators.

- Fixed
  - The system progresses through the phases on specific predefined dates
- Fluid
  - The system progresses through the phases after specific predefined durations
- User Defined
  - The system progresses through the phases after user defined durations
